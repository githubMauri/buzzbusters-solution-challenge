We also want to mention that we continue working with AutoML, Google Vertex AI, and Google Cloud Storage to improve our project.

# BuzzBusters Project

We are actively working, iterating, and constantly testing new models. As a result, we have created several repositories with different trained models.

## Model 2 - First Version - EfficientDet-D1 (Tested and working on Raspberry Pi 4 for the TOP 100 Solution Challenge)

This is the repository of the trained model used in the BuzzBusters project:

https://github.com/githubMauri/buzzbusters-raspberrypi4-v1

## Model 1 - Third Version - AutoML trained on Google Vertex AI

We have created several versions of this model throughout our project:

* The first version was trained with 1600 images in 8 hours.
* The second version was trained with 8,302 images in 12 hours.
* The third version was trained with 9,119 images in 24 hours.

## Engaging the Community: Mobile Application for Mosquito Reporting and Control

The solution includes a mobile application for the public to report mosquito sightings and track the progress of mosquito control efforts in their area. It also provides information on symptoms and preventive measures. With this mobile application, we engage the community in mosquito control efforts and enhance the effectiveness of our solution.
